# Pig Game 🎲

This is a simple dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's based on the classic **Pig Game** where two players take turns rolling a dice and try to reach 100 points first.

## 🚀 How to Play

- Two players take turns.
- On each turn, a player can roll the dice:
  - If they roll a **1**, their **current score resets** and it’s the next player’s turn.
  - If they roll **2–6**, the number is added to their current score.
- The player can **hold** to add the current score to their total score and pass the turn.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins!
